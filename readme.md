## Dataset

> I worked on Flights dataset which  reports flights in the United States, 
including carriers, arrival and departure delays, and reasons for delays
It contains more than 7 million air flights and what I wanted to work on is
 the departure delay to know which factors affects it and know the performance 
of each company during 2008 .
 


## Summary of Findings

> Delay time varies by day and time, also companies that have a lower delay and cancellation rate get more passengers
So I was able to find that South west air line  get twice as many passengers as your its nearest competitor
And although it is very crowded, it maintains a small delay rate in most comparisons.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Comparing the average delay for each company and also the cancellation rate.
> Airlines performance during the year  (Average Delay as a performance Key indicator).
> I focused more on the most important airline to know when it has much delay.
I found that mostly on late hours also on fridays and Sundays.
